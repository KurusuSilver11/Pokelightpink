# **Pokémon Light Pink - Credits**



--



So, I never thought I'd have to say this, but I'm pretty much done trying to make Light Pink.



For now.



Why? 



Well, it's simply because *I don't know what I can even do to this project anymore.*



I can't code or draw, and don't see figuring out either in the near future.

I do plan to learn art someday, but I'm far too busy at home to do it, and a family member just lost their job, so I can't afford a drawing pad anyway. As for coding, no matter what I try, I just feel like I can't learn it. It just goes over my head. Maybe someday things will be different and I'll be able to learn.



Now, this isn't the end of Light Pink.



Simply an undefined hiatus. 



I am open-sourcing this project and leaving my notes of what I wanted to do with it.



And if any coders (and maybe \[BUT NOT ALTERNATIVELY] more sprite artists) gain interest in continuing the project, let me know and I'd fire it up asap. Literally the main issue here is lack of coders.



Also, every custom asset in the game is free use with credit. Credit the person mentioned below related to the specific asset.



I started this project out of impulse because I randomly started liking Pyukumuku. Then I got more and more ideas for what I could do for the postgame, and yeah, turns out I kinda can't do crap about anything without knowing how.



I'm honestly surprised I got this far. I thought I'd fail at the intro movie, or adding Acid Spray/Quiver Dance, or even getting people interested in my hack.



Thanks for helping so far, it means a lot to me.



I'll stop yapping now.
