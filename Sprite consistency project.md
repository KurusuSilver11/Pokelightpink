### **Pokelightpink sprite consistency project**

**KurusuSilver11**



#### **DO THE PROJECT IN THE SECOND BRANCH TITLED "Sprite-consistency-project"**



**Do not edit:**

* Front sprites
* Beta Pokémon (i.e. from Spaceworld, like Riifi)
* "Eevees" is a special SW Eevee. Do not touch its sprites.
* Devmon (Developer-addition Pokémon, such as Zappuru and Subfearow)

If in doubt, ask KurusuSilver11 on Discord.



The point is to make the Back-Sprites match the Front-Sprites. This may include redoing the shading completely, changing some details, and most importantly removing a large majority of dithering from generation 2's shading system.



For example, Chansey's Back-Sprite may require heavy shading rework to match the Front-Sprite, and Gastly will likely require most of the dithering to be removed to be consistent with the Front-Sprite. Rapidash and Ponyta's fire are also notable.



Here are some I have already worked on, but you may make further change if you deem it necessary.

* Farfetch'd; Required a coloration overhaul. If you think I did a poor job, do it yourself or point it out for someone else.
* Gengar
* Golduck
* Growlithe
* Haunter
* Ivysaur
* Meowth
* Pinsir
* Starmie



*Still, consider looking at these and fixing them if you think any of them look bad.*



**Pokémon to especially look at for shading overhaul:**

* Nidoqueen
* Hitmonlee
* Hitmonchan?
* Horsea
* Magnemite
* Magneton\* (If changed, consider looking at Clusterton)
* Staryu
* Mankey?
* Primeape?
* Tentacrool
* Venomoth
* Metapod?
* Diglett
* Dugtrio; Both of this line have to have the dirt around them un-dithered, match the Front-Sprite.
* Anything else with fire (Charizard), dirt or whatever is to be looked at as well especially. **TRY TO MATCH FRONTSPRITE STYLE**.



Note: Exeggutor's Back-Sprite is ripped from the GS SpaceWorld '97 Demo; Its Back-Sprite, other than shading, pretty much exactly matched GSC. And since I like that shading, I decided to keep that instead of making y'all modify the final GSC one.



**Jynx:**
I didn't like how Jynx's Yellow sprite looked, so I changed it to one from GS. Hence the white hair (and purple skin in-game). If one of you wants to just make a new Front-Sprite, let me know.



**Venusaur:**

vladoptimus is already editing/creating a Back-Sprite to match Venusaur's flower design in Yellow. **Do not bother editing Venusaur's Back-Sprite in the disassembly right now.**



**New sprites:**
If the Back-Sprite simply looks bad with gen 1 shading and detail, consider having a new one created instead. 48x48, gen 2 size but gen 1 style. Also, ask me first. And to be honest, I am unsure of anyone else's ability to create gen 1-style sprites than Corylus.



Everyone who works on it legitimately will be credited, even if just one sprite.



**Also:**

Some of the sprites' file sizes are under 1KB. This is because of a lossless compression. It will be undone upon saving, most likely. It does not matter, I am only mentioning this because it can mess with color changing (although you should keep it **EXACTLY** to the four colors already on the image), so if you get issues just save it in MS Paint or something and it'll decompress and act as expected. You might not even have these issues. Articuno's Back-Sprite is an example, currently.
