Note: "KURUSU" is placeholder for the player. "SEB" is placeholder for rival. (I used those in the ROM's Debug Mode lol)

Note 2: Apparently GitHub might have f'd up the formatting on this a bit and I'm not fixing it. 

After you beat the elite four, if you visit Professor Oak, he will have something for you.

Rough text idea: (I tried formatting it similarly to how it would be in-game, but I know it still would have to be much more broken to actually work lol)

"Ah, KURUSU! Convenient timing!"
"I have received a strange package with your name on it."
"It contains this ticket, old map,"
"And this chip that seems to go into"
"Your Pokédex!"
"They appear very old, how strange."
"I can try installing the chip,"
"But I am not sure what it will do."

Oak then upgrades the Pokédex to have 3+ new categories (subject to change depending on what can actually be implemented); One for some new Pokémon such as Zillgoa and Pinkachu, and another for the Beta Pokémon, plus the extra for Unown (identical to gen 2 if I can implement it).

"How interesting!"
"Some new pages have appeared on"
"your Pokédex! I wonder what new"
"Pokémon they are for?"

"Oh, and here's the other stuff,"
"If you want them."

Oak gives the ARCH. TICKET and MYSTERYMAP.

"I heard a sailor is visiting Cinnabar."
"Maybe you can have him take a look?"
"I've never seen the land seen on"
"this map before."



Sailor David is his name. He's an old man who owns no Pokémon and lives on his ship. He has no family. Not anymore.
(I made this up one evening lol I could probably change it)
(Fun fact, he's based on another old man that would've been important in an older project I recycled for a lot of this. Would've ended up with the same Pokémon as well, a Beta Girafarig.)

If interacted with while the two items are in your Inventory...

"Oh, hello young man."
"What? You have something to show me?"
"A map and ticket? How strange."
"Show me that map for a minute."

"I do not remember these islands"
"on any map... Are you sure this"
"is a real map?"
"What, you want me to bring you"
"to there?"

"...Eh, fine. What do I have to"
"lose?"

"My only condition is that you"
"don't try and steal anything."

"Come into my boat when you"
"are ready."

You are supposed to enter the ship. You can technically do anything else before that, but wouldn't it be rude to make him wait forever?

Anyway, when you go in, he will enter after you and go to the helm.

"You're lucky some of the rocks"
"surrounding here disappeared"
"yesterday. I wouldn't even"
"have gotten here otherwise."
(No really I would remove some of the border rocks from the map for this)

The ship then sets sail, southwest to where the map says...

You have then reached the Archipelago. (Name pending)

"We have arrived. I think."
"I can't believe this place"
"was here, when I haven't"
"seen this on any other map!"

"Explore all you want. I'm"
"staying here for now."
"Let me know if you want"
"to leave."

David will remain in the boat. For now.

As for the Archipelago...

It is a mysterious set of islands with strange new Pokémon and powerful trainers that rule each island.

(The Island Rulers will be based on developers of the game. This includes me.)

Each Island will have at least one new Pokémon available, such as the Frozen Wing to evolve Fearow into Subfearow, or the ability to catch a Clusterton. To catch it, you must beat the Ruler. ("Island Ruler" is a WIP name btw)

However, for my island, after you beat the guy based on me, my Devmon (Pinkachu) will run off.
He'll somehow get all the way to Kanto. Cinnabar, Pallet, Viridian, then Viridian Forest, where he'll get distracted by another Pokémon and get cornered by you. Then you may catch him.

Back to the Archipelago.

All other Islands are to be determined by the rest of the developers other than Mai Island (Main Island, WIP name), my Island, and Lost Island.

Mai Island is where you and David originally went. It has some rare Pokémon encounters and a motel ran by a Chansey where you can restore your Pokémon.
Note that you cannot use Fly at the Archipelago. Your Pokémon simply refuse. They don't know the way back.

At Chansey's Motel, there is a ticket machine. You put the ARCH. TICKET into it, and it dispenses a bigger map, the FULLMAP. You are supposed to show it to David.

"Huh? You have another map?"
"Let me see."
"..."
"There's more islands!?"
"Well, I suppose you"
"want to go to them."
"Fine, then."
"Which island would you"
"like to visit?"

You are then prompted with a choice between every island, plus a Cancel button.

Cancel:
"Just wasting my time?"
"Fine. Just come back"
"if you make up your"
"mind."

Back to Kanto:
"Done here? Okay then."
"Back to Cinnabar."

Most Islands:
"(Island Name)?"
"If you say so."
"All aboard."

Island you're already on:
"Okay."
"..."
"Would you look"
"at that, we're"
"here. Happy?"

Lost Island (first time):
"Really? that one?"
"That tiny unnamed"
"island? Whatever"
"you say."

Lost Island (further times):
"Okay, then."
"Let's go."

I will not bother writing here for the other islands, since they haven't been decided at all yet, and they are not important to the postgame story.

As for Lost Island...

It is a small island around the size of Cinnabar, but with no buildings other than a strange blue house. There is no music.
It probably uses a tileset from Beta GS.

When you go inside, the game crashes... (not really, but ideally I would want it to look like it does)

Your Pokémon are sent to a free box, and your items are sent to the PC.
For idiotproofing, half the boxes in the game probably were disabled and only active now; One box was held only so your Pokémon could be sent there, and the rest are for here. This is all assuming I can't add more boxes. If I could, I would likely instead just have more boxes be unlocked and not have any of the original ones disabled.

You wake up in a strange bedroom.
It's the house you start at in the Spaceworld 97 demo.
You're in Silent Hill (The starting location in the demo).

You go downstairs. The woman at the table is surprised at your presence, and starts speaking in Japanese. When she realizes you don't understand her, she roughly says the words "Go... Lab", or something like that.

When you get there, you see what you think is Professor Oak, but it is actually an imposter...

He greets himself as such, in English (He and some others learned it before the big scrapping). He explains where you are and what happened.

Long ago, the god of Pokémon, "Arceus", was creating the world. However, he chose to scrap this part of it, casting it into the void and replacing it with the modern Johto. He salvaged few and threw away the rest.
Imposter Oak used to be a villain, but after the world was thrown away, he realized that since the real Oak was taken for reuse (and Elm didn't exist in the demo), they had no real Professor. So he started trying to study with what was left behind and steer their world into salvation.

He is surprised when you tell him how you got here, saying they had nothing to do with that, but it is exciting that there is still some form of possible link between the worlds.
Imposter Oak reveals that he was the creator of the Pokédex upgrade chip, but didn't know where it went, since it disappeared from his lab a few days ago.

"Oak" then realizes you do not have any Pokémon. When you say you had some, he theorizes that they didn't come through the portal with you. He then offers one of two Starter Pokémon; Happa and Honooguma; Kurusu was already taken by someone else that Imposter Oak says you'll meet soon enough. You can only have one because Imposter Oak still needs at least one.

After you make your choice, Imposter Oak offers to battle you so you can get familiar with your new Pokémon. This is probably optional. He uses the other Starter.

Regardless, afterwards he tells you to go west to オールドシティ, "Old City", saying that someone will be at the tower. He also gives you some Poké Balls.

You're free to catch whatever on the way there, such as beta Hoothoot, Marill and Girafarig.

Most of the NPCs speak Japanese, with very few knowing some English. (This assumes I manage to upgrade the text engine to support 2 languages dynamically. Otherwise, all of them speak boring English)

...And that's all I wrote. I'll write some more plot points now in no order (mostly).

* Beta Falkner would've had a Beta Scizor. He would be the reason for its new custom signature move, Dual-Cleave or whatever (35 power, flying, +1 priority, always crit, hits twice, could've been nerfed if deemed too OP tho. FWI Beta Scizor is Bug/Flying). He'd be a main character in this story, probably.
* The Demo's Player, Koji, is met in Old City, being the guy you meet at the tower. He serves as one of the main characters similar to the rival, but not mean at all and more focused on salvation. He has a Skateboard.
* True Arceus, in his weakened state, would be rescued from the void by the player or something, possibly using a Glitch Pokémon (spitballing right now). He would not be caught yet, however.
* Speaking of the Void, I mean the undefined area that would normally crash the game. You are given the ability to somehow go in there and live, I haven't decided on specifics yet.
* The Spaceworld's remnants of Team Rocket would be revealed to be reformed due to their crisis. They would be allies.
* Sailor David would end up being found in Silent Hill, having followed you after a few hours of you not returning. He would befriend a Beta Girafarig and eventually reunite with you later on.
* True Arceus would request that you locate His Legendary Beasts (Rai, En, Sui), which would be able to help him regain his abilities. All three are in specific locations.
* At some point, once you catch all three and True Arceus is stronger, Faker would take notice and start attacking.
* The war begins; Faker uses Dialga and Palkia to try and eliminate Beta Johto. True Arceus tries to help fend them off, and requests you go back into the void and look for his own old allies, the Beta Dialga, Palkia and Giratina (Note: All but Giratina look pretty similar to the final versions, I'm spitballing a lot right now and am going off Beta DPPT's sprites) to help.
* Beta Dialga and Palkia are pretty standard to catch. Beta Giratina requires some chase in the void before he finally listens to B-Dialga and B-Palkia.
* Once you have all three, you go back up to Johto2. Faker is currently winning, but the B-Creation trio intervene and defend True Arceus before Faker can finish him off.
* Faker's Dialga and Palkia are confused by the B-Trio, but are ordered to keep attacking.
* B-Giratina uses its Distortion abilities to call Faker's Giratina...
* Giratina, in this hack's continuity, was sealed away for finding the truth about Faker millennia ago and rebelling against them.
* The two Giratina force a connection between Johto2 and the main world, revealing True Arceus (and Faker's wrath) to the world.
* Faker is enraged. He orders Dialga and Palkia to attack, but Imposter Oak (or someone else, haven't decided) shouts the truth to them.
* Eventually, both of them turn on Faker.
* However, Faker exerts his full power to KO everyone involved in the fight, except for True Arceus and you (True Arceus protected you).
* B-Creation Trio give the last of their power to True Arceus, whom gains his full power. He then entrusts you to assist it and defeat the Faker.
* Final battle between the two. Faker has the base 120 stats you know of and is Normal Type. True Arceus is Typeless and, in his full power (that you'll never see again in-game), has base 160 offenses with 130 on the other stats. You simply defeat Faker.
* Faker is cast into the void, and True Arceus uses his excess power to restore Johto2 to the main world (without erasing main Johto) and heal everyone.
  That's the end of the main postgame plot. You cannot catch Faker in this game (that's for the sequel), nor main Dialga/Palkia/Giratina. However, the B-Trio allow you to obtain them for free (spitballing), having already gained full respect for you.
* Once you complete all Pokédexes in the game, True Arceus will allow you to fight him at Beta Mt. Fuji or whatever in his Main forme (base 130 stats across board). He cannot be caught in-battle, but once you defeat him he gifts himself to you; However, he makes it clear he will come and go as he pleases (not an in-game mechanic, just basic lore).
* True Arceus' signature move is still Judgement, but it's 100 power Typeless. Note that for balance, he 1. knows no setup moves, and 2. does not have Recover, but probably the lower-PP Moonlight or something. These are self-inflicted restraints. Probably still an Uber. Even in the gen 2 sequel he won't use Plates.



* Beta Ho-Oh would appear at a Tower or something in the post-postgame. He was drained of power and hidden for the whole story, but regenerated when True Arceus healed everyone.
* Beta Celebi, Mitei, would be attracted to the energy from True Arceus and reveal itself in Silent Hill in post-postgame; It was lost in the void, but followed the energy signals into visibility. Mitel is likely a Normal-Type. Mitei will be necessary to catch Celebi in the sequel via Time Capsule transfer to obtain the GS Ball. They knew each other for the short duration where Celebi was created but Mitel wasn't banished yet.



I'm done typing this now, I guess. I won't draft the Sequel's plot more than I already did in notes.



I hope this isn't too cringy, I just started typing what I had in my head. I'm just glad it's finally written down. This is all subject to change for multiple reasons, such as capability to implement in-game, whether something was decided too cringy, etc.

I kinda forgot about Beta Celebi, Koji and Sailor David halfway through writing this, so just assume they'd have roles in practice during the game (Other than Beta Celebi/Mitei, I just put him in postpostgame for this draft cuz of this. Could probably be changed tho)

If any of the Lore Notes contradict this, it's because those were written months ago and the second half of this file was written today.
