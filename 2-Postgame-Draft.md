Note: "KURUSU" is placeholder for the player. "SEB" is placeholder for rival. (I used those in the ROM's Debug Mode lol)
(Seb is the shortened username of a good friend of mine in the Discord server)

After you beat the elite four, if you visit Professor Oak, he will have something for you.

Rough text idea: (I know it'd have to be broken-up ingame to actually work)

"Ah, KURUSU! Convenient timing! I have received a strange package with your name on it."

"It contains this ticket, old map, and this chip that looks like it's meant to go into a Pokédex!"

"It's very strange. I can try installing the chip, but I can't promise it won't break it."

Oak then upgrades the Pokédex to have several new categories (subject to change depending on what can actually be implemented); 

- Beta Pokémon (SW 97)
- Other Beta Pokémon (Gen 1 betas, some non-main SW betas, etc.)
- Devmons (Term for the developer-addition Pokémon such as Pinkachu and Zillgoa)
- Generation 2 Pokémon
- Unown
- Spaceworld 1997's set of Unown
  (No particular order of categories listed)

"How interesting! Some new pages have appeared on your Pokédex! I wonder what new Pokémon they are for?"

"Oh, and here's the other items that were included."

Oak gives the ARCH. TICKET and MYSTERYMAP.
(Archipelago Ticket is full name of the former, to be clear.)

"I heard a sailor is visiting Cinnabar. Maybe you can have him take a look?"

"I've never heard of the land seen on this map before."



Sailor David is his name. He's an old man who owns no Pokémon and lives on his ship. He has no family. Not anymore. 
(I made this up one evening lol I could probably change it)

(Fun fact, he's based on another old man that would've been important in an older project I recycled for a lot of this. Would've ended up with the same Pokémon as well, a Beta Girafarig.)

If interacted with while the two items are in your Inventory...

"Oh, hello young man. What? You have something to show me?"

"A map and ticket? How strange. Show me that map for a minute."

"I do not remember these islands on any map... Are you sure this is a real map?"

"What, you want me to bring you to there?"

"...Eh, fine. What do I have to lose? I have nothing else to do anymore."

"My only condition is that you don't try and steal anything on my boat. Come in when you're ready."

You are supposed to enter the ship. You can technically do anything else before that, but wouldn't it be rude to make him wait forever?

Anyway, when you go in, he will enter after you and go to the helm.

"You're lucky some of the rocks surrounding here disappeared yesterday."

"I wouldn't even have arrived in Kanto otherwise, I was rather lost."

(No really I would remove some of the border rocks from the map for this)

The ship then sets sail, southwest to where the map says...

You have then reached the Archipelago. (Name pending)

"We have arrived. I can't believe this, I haven't even heard of here before..."

"Explore all you want. I'm staying on board for now."
"Let me know when you're ready to leave."

David will remain in the boat. For now.

As for the Archipelago...

It is a mysterious set of islands with strange new Pokémon and powerful trainers that rule each island.

(The Island Rulers will be based on developers of the game. This includes me.)

Each Island will have at least one new Pokémon available, such as the Frozen Wing to evolve Fearow into Subfearow, or the ability to catch a Clusterton. To catch it, you must beat the Ruler. ("Island Ruler" is a WIP name btw)

However, for my island, after you beat the guy based on me, my Devmon (Pinkachu) will run off.
He'll somehow get all the way to Kanto. Cinnabar, Pallet, Viridian, then Viridian Forest, where he'll get distracted by another Pokémon and get cornered by you. Then you may catch him.

Short story about Pinkachu.
Back when I just started trying to figure out Pokeyellow, I tried adding Pyukumuku. However, I was an idiot and put him at the top on a few lists, which shifted everything below it down one space. At first this made all the sprites static, but after fixing that, in the intro scene, Pikachu had Arbok's palette. I found this kind of funny, and later decided to add it as my Devmon, Pinkachu. He still uses Arbok's palette. Technically it's "PAL_PURPLEMON", but with GBC color correction on BGB Emulator it looks more Pink to me, hence the name and custom typing of Electric/Pink (Plus, Purplechu sounds kind of cringy).
He was meant to be rather antimeta; Pink resists Psychic and is weak to Dragon (the only widespread dragon move in the game so far is a 100 power special Outrage) and itself. 
Its stats are based on Pikachu but jacked up, with 35 HP, 85 ATK, 40 DEF, 119 SPD, 110 SPC. Enough speed to outspeed 110 SPE Raichu, but outsped by Dugtrio. Does not learn Surf (he can't swim), so it mostly walled by Rhydon/Golem. 
His signature move is Paz Yppiz (Zippy Zap from LGPE). 50 power, Pink-type (no offensive resistances), +1 priority and always crits. No, I would most likely never nerf this. He's countered by anything with decent defense and Earthquake. Oh, and I gave Raichu's line Volt Tackle, but not Pinkachu if I recall correctly.
Final fun fact about him, his original sprites were the SW 97 Pikachu sprites, but then I wanted him to look more like Modern Pikachu so I changed it accordingly.

Back to the Archipelago.

All other Islands are to be determined by the rest of the developers other than Mai Island (Main Island, WIP name), my Island, and Lost Island.

Mai Island is where you and David originally went. It has some rare Pokémon encounters and a motel ran by a Chansey where you can restore your Pokémon.
Note that you cannot use Fly at the Archipelago. Your Pokémon simply refuse. They don't know the way back.

At Chansey's Motel, there is a ticket machine. You put the ARCH. TICKET into it, and it dispenses a bigger map, the FULLMAP. You are supposed to show it to David.

"Huh? You have another map? Let me see." 

"...There's more islands!? Well, I suppose you want to go to them?"

"Fine. Which island are we going to next?"

You are then prompted with a choice between every island, plus a Cancel button.

Cancel:
"Just wasting my time?"

"Fine. Just come back if you make up your mind."

Back to Kanto:
"Done here? Okay then. Back to Cinnabar."

Most Islands:
"(Island Name)?"

"If you say so. All aboard."

Island you're already on:
"Okay, sure."

"...Would you look at that, we're here. Happy?"

Lost Island (first time):
"Really? that one? That tiny unnamed island? Whatever you say."

Lost Island (further times):
"Okay, then. Let's go."

I will not bother writing here for the other islands, since they haven't been decided at all yet, and they are not important to the postgame's story.

As for Lost Island...

It is a small island around the size of Cinnabar, but with no buildings other than a strange blue house. There is no music.
It probably uses a tileset from Beta GS.

When you go inside, the game crashes... (not really, but ideally I would want it to look like an out-of-bounds crash from Pokémon Green)

Your Pokémon (except Pyukumuku) are sent to a free box, and your items are sent to the PC. Pyukumuku, meanwhile, is lowered to Level 5 again due to corruption.
To prevent the boxes being full, I would hope to expand the box number. If that proves impossible in a rational way, I'd just withhold a few boxes from the base set until now, but that is not ideal, especially with all the new Pokémon added.
Same with the PC, I'd want to add more spaces (or a page 2-3).

You wake up in a strange bedroom.
It's the house you start at in the Spaceworld 97 demo.
You're in Silent Hill (The starting location in the demo).

You go downstairs. The woman at the table is surprised at your presence, and starts speaking in Japanese. When she realizes you don't understand her, she roughly says the words "Go... Lab". (Sounds weird to me on paper but I assume it'd look fine in-game)

When you get there, you see what you think is Professor Oak, but it is actually an imposter...

He greets himself as, in English (He and some others learned it before the incident, maybe) as literally the Imposter Oak. He explains where you are and what happened;

Long ago, the god of Pokémon, "Arceus", was creating the world. However, he chose to scrap this part of it (like the actual beta content out-of-universe), casting it into the void and replacing it with the modern Johto. He salvaged few and threw away the rest. (This story is wrong because they don't actually know)
Imposter Oak was going to be a villain, but after this world was thrown away, he realized that since the real Oak was taken for reuse (and Elm didn't exist in the demo), they had no real Professor. So he started trying to study with what was left behind and steer their world into salvation.

He is surprised when you tell him how you got here, saying they had nothing to do with that, but it is exciting that there is still some form of possible link between the worlds.
Imposter Oak reveals that he was the creator of the Pokédex upgrade chip, but didn't know where it went, since it disappeared from his lab a few days ago.
(Pinkachu stole it, then it was modified to include modern gen 2, devmons etc. and left in Real Oak's lab for you)

"Oak" then realizes you do not have any Pokémon other than Pyukumuku, whom he does not recognize. When you say that you had some others previously, he theorizes that they didn't come through the portal with you. He then offers one of two Starter Pokémon (since Pyukumuku looks rather weak), Happa and Honooguma; Kurusu was already taken by someone else that Imposter Oak says you'll meet soon enough. You can only have one, because Imposter Oak still needs at least one for himself.

After you make your choice, Imposter Oak offers to battle you so you can get familiar with your new Pokémon. This is probably optional (especially since if you pick Happa you're at a disadvantage against him). He uses the other Starter.

Regardless, afterwards he tells you to go west to オールドシティ, "Old City", saying that someone will be at the tower. He also gives you some Poké Balls.

You're free to catch whatever on the way there, such as beta Hoothoot, Marill and Girafarig.

Most of the NPCs speak Japanese, with very few knowing some English. (This assumes my team managed to upgrade the text engine to support 2 languages dynamically. Otherwise, all of them speak boring English, sorry.)

...And that's all I wrote previously. I'll write some more plot points now in no order (mostly). It's putting together everything I had in mind as well as heavy spitballing to connect it all. Sorry if you think it's cringy, I did my best.

* Beta Falkner would've had a Beta Scizor. He would be the reason for its new custom signature move, Dual-Cleave or whatever (35 power, flying, +1 priority, always crit, hits twice, could've been nerfed if deemed too OP tho. FWI Beta Scizor is Bug/Flying). He'd be a main character in this story, probably.
* The Demo's Player, Koji, is met in Old City, being the guy you meet at the tower. He serves as one of the main characters similar to the rival, but not mean at all and more focused on salvation. He has a Skateboard, and his partners are Kurusu and his shiny Marill, whom follows him around (maybe).
* After some other stuff, the real/True Arceus, in his weakened state, would be rescued from the void by the player and Koji, possibly using a Glitch Pokémon (spitballing right now). He would not be caught yet, however.
* Speaking of the Void, I mean the undefined area that would normally crash the game. Perhaps some SW Unown guide you or something, I haven't decided on specifics yet.
* True Arceus would tell you about the False Arceus being the one to have done all this, and requests that you locate True Arceus' Legendary Beasts (Rai, En, Sui from SW 97), which would be able to help him regain his abilities. All three are in specific locations and aren't roaming encounters.
(Fun fact, I previously have referred to False Arceus as Faker Arceus, but as of last night I decided that was cringe and changed it.)

* At some point, once you catch all three (takes a while, there's some other tasks & exploration to do between each of em) and True Arceus is stronger, the False Arceus would take notice and start attacking this world.
* The war begins; False Arceus uses Dialga and Palkia to try and eliminate Beta Johto. True Arceus tries to help fend them off, and requests you go back into the void and look for his own old allies, the Beta Dialga, Palkia and Giratina (Note: All but Giratina look pretty similar to the final versions, I'm spitballing a lot right now and am going off Beta DPPT's sprites) to help.
* Beta Dialga and Palkia are pretty standard to catch. Beta Giratina requires some chase in the void before he finally listens to B-Dialga and B-Palkia to stop.
* Once you have all three, you go back up to Johto2. False Arceus is currently winning, but the B-Creation trio intervene and defend True Arceus before False can finish him off.
* False's Dialga and Palkia are confused by the B-Trio's existence, especially B-Giratina, but are ordered to keep attacking.
* After defeating both Dialga and Palkia in battle (they are both healed by False, however), B-Giratina uses its Distortion abilities to call False's Giratina;
* Giratina, in this hack's continuity, was sealed away for finding the truth about the False Arceus millennia ago and rebelling against them.
* The two Giratina force a connection between Johto2 and the main world, revealing True Arceus (and False Arceus' wrath) to the world in real time.
* False Arceus is enraged. He orders Dialga and Palkia to attack, but Imposter Oak (or someone else, haven't decided) shouts the truth to them.
* Eventually, both of them turn on False Arceus.
* However, False Arceus exerts his full power to KO everyone involved in the fight, except for True Arceus and you (True Arceus protected you).
* Barely still conscious, the B-Creation Trio give the last of their power to True Arceus, finally regaining his full power. He then entrusts you to assist it and defeat the False Arceus and restore this world.
* Final battle between the two. Faker has the base 120 stats you're familiar with and is Normal Type. True Arceus is Typeless and, in his full power (that you'll never see again in-game), has base 160 offenses with 130 on the other stats. You simply have to defeat False Arceus. Shouldn't be too hard with True Arceus' power.
* False Arceus, now powerless, is cast into the void. True Arceus uses his excess power to restore Johto2 to the main world (without erasing main Johto) and heal everyone, with the help of both sets of the Creation Trio.

That's the end of the main postgame plot. You cannot catch False Arceus in this game (that's for the sequel), nor main Dialga/Palkia/Giratina. However, the B-Trio will allow you to obtain them for free before you exit, having already gained full respect for you.

Then the credits are shown once again, perhaps different from the original if I can put in two different sets of credits.
And for the record, Pyukumuku is just there with you throughout all of this. Maybe a few comments about him from people. You already had your moments with him by now, anyway.

And now, for the post-postgame content.

* Johto2 can now be reached anytime with Sailor David at Cinnabar Island. It was placed south of Kanto and the main Johto (still inaccessable in Light Pink, sorry). Pinkachu's Paz Yppiz, which was listed as an unusable HM move, now allows you to fast-travel through Johto2. (Pending capability of implementation) You still can't Fly here.
* Lost Island's house is now locked, and won't open again.
* Professor Oak and Imposter Oak discuss recent events at New Tech.
* Beta Ho-Oh now appears at Old City's Tower (Maybe). He was drained of power and MIA for the whole story, but regenerated its energy when True Arceus restored everyone. His stats are a little different from Modern Ho-Oh, and there is likely no Beta Lugia.
* Beta Celebi, AKA Mitei, was attracted to the energy True Arceus released and reveals itself in Silent Hill in post-postgame after you and the two Oaks talk; It was lost in the void, but followed the energy signals back into Johto2. Mitel is likely a Normal-Type, as per Demo data. Mitei will be necessary to catch Celebi in the sequel via Time Capsule transfer to obtain the GS Ball. They were friends for the short duration where Celebi was created but Mitel wasn't banished by False Arceus yet.
* Imposter Oak finally obtains more of the starters, and will allow you to obtain the 2 you didn't have if you beat him in battle (He has the fully-evolved form of Happa/Honooguma plus the non-starter Pokemon that Oak's unused battle team had, which were in disabled Pokeballs that True Arceus fixed).
* Professor Oak, meanwhile, will give you a Tyrogue he ordered from Main Johto, so you can get the one you didn't get from the Dojo. As for eevee, it's already available at the Game Corner in this game. Beta Eevee is probably also found somewhere in Johto2 other than a gift.
* Mew is reported to be somewhere in Viridian Forest as a static encounter. SW Mew can be obtained afterwards, perhaps in Blue Forest.
* The SW Legendary Birds appear in undecided areas.

* Once you complete the **entire** available Pokédex (Main 151 + all Betamons + Devmons but not Gen 2, which mostly isn't catchable here), True Arceus will allow you to fight him at Beta Mt. Fuji or whatever in his Main forme (base 130 stats across board). He cannot be caught in-battle, but once you defeat him he gifts himself to you; However, he makes it clear he will come and go as he pleases (not an in-game mechanic, just basic lore).
* True Arceus' signature move is still Judgement, but it's 100 power Typeless. Note that for balance, he 1. knows no setup moves, and 2. does not have Recover, probably just Rest. These are self-inflicted restraints. Probably still an Uber. Even in the gen 2 sequel he won't use Plates.

I'm done typing this now, I guess. I won't draft the Sequel's plot more than I already did in notes. I didn't have a whole lot decided for it anyway.


I hope this isn't too cringy, I just started typing what I had in my head. I'm just glad it's finally written down. This is all subject to change for multiple reasons, such as capability to implement in-game, whether something was decided too cringy, etc.

I kinda forgot about Beta Celebi, Koji and Sailor David halfway through writing this, so just assume they'd have roles in practice during the game (Other than Beta Celebi/Mitei, I just put him in postpostgame for this draft cuz of this. Could probably be changed tho)

If any of the Lore Notes contradict this, it's because those were written months ago and the second half of this file was written today.
