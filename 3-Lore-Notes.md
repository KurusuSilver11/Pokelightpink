Koji

Demo player's name is コージ, Kōji. I took the Debug name because both demo names are taken by anime characters or something. I'm aware this is the name of the Snorlax guy.
He has a brother named ケン, Ken.
Backstory:

Koji was going to be the protagonist of Gold and Silver, but he was scrapped along with the rest of that version of the world. He was stuck there.

His starter is a Kurusu. He also has a shiny Marill named Pikblue that he found randomly while wandering his broken world (Yes I really caught that full-odds randomly in the demo).

Secret lore: The Johto protagonist was built with some copied fragments of Koji.

Koji (Continued)

His team is based of my experience of the Debug mode of the demo. This includes the fact he has a shiny Marill.

I explored every town. This is why Imposter Oak lives in High Tech (His sprite is there), he has a wife (lady in same house), etc etc.

Any Pokémon I caught there, Koji canonically will own in this continuity.

Current Team: Kurusu, Shiny Marill, Hoothoot, Ledyba, I'm also trying to catch a Vulpix (or pre-evo)

Lore of the land

I'm gonna call this Johto2 until I find an actual region name (Might actually still just be Johto I genuinely do not know)

"Long ago, the god of Pokémon, "Arceus", was creating the world. However, he chose to scrap this part of it, casting it into the void and replacing it with the modern Johto. He salvaged few and threw away the rest."

The extended true version:

Long ago, there was not one Egg, but two. There hatched two Pokémon; Two gods. One took the name Arceus, but the other wanted the same.

They created the original Kanto together. Pokémon Red/Green.

However, while Johto was being created, the two got into a fight. The lesser one wanted to take over.

Unfortunately, the lesser one, deemed a Faker, won. True Arceus was sapped of its power and banished into the void, as did most of that build of Johto.

Faker Arceus then made the rest of the world, but it is all imperfect and flashy compared to what True Arceus would have done.

Faker has a bit of an ego and took an extravagant form, and wiped True Arceus from all records of history, replacing it with himself. True Arceus is more of a blur in appearance (the beta Arceus from DP Beta).

Notably, one of True Arceus' last creations was an old version of what became Celebi. It was banished a while after when Faker decided to make a new one.

There is also Beta Versions of the Lake Trio, but that's likely a Sequel thing and I also only have Backsprites to work with there.

Note that this hack largely didn't follow a lot of lore that was revealed in Legends, mostly because I recycled some of this from a scrapped non-ROM Hack project years ago.

Sequel ideas

Alternative history; Due to the events of Light Pink, some things are different.

* Some Beta Pokémon have began inhabiting some of the normal world.
* Beta Johto was placed south of the real Johto/Kanto by True Arceus sometime after Light Pink, and has become a relatively popular tourist attraction. However, tourists must be wary to not damage anything. Notably, the air feels the same, strange clouds surrounding the land.
* Gym Leaders, among others, use some Beta Pokémon.
* Some people have a bit of an identity crisis over doppelgangers from Spaceworld, such as Jasmine, Falkner etc.
* Imposter Oak is now a licensed professor who is the head of the Beta Pokémon study.
* Faker Arceus, in its unpowered defeated state, was taken by Team Truth.
* Team Rocket was disbanded by Team Beta Rocket sometime between the events of Light Pink and the sequel, OR Team Rocket and Team Beta Rocket are at war
* Pokémon Tower was not replaced with a Radio tower, and instead was built next to the town on Route 8. This is because some of the people who were in Johto2 felt disgusted at such an idea, so the original idea was scrapped.
* The Pokédex now naturally has the Beta Pokémon as a category.
* The Archipelago disappeared after the events of Light Pink, for until someone else finds a map and ticket.
* Light (Player) disappeared into the Archipelago.
* The Mount Silver battle is replaced with another character.

New villains:

Team Truth
Terrorists who are against the existence of the people from Johto2, and still worship the Fake Arceus. Their leader is Rann, a mentally ill man who was obsessed with Arceus and sees the True Arceus and its people as evil.

They recovered the Faker and will attempt to banish the True Arceus once again and destroy all the people from the void. They often terrorize Beta Pokémon.

Layout of the region (Demo; Some will be fixed in hack):

* All gym buildings seem to be marked with a sign that says in English "LEAGUE". The first room seems to be a classroom, with stairs that lead to the actual gym room. The front map that looks like there'd be a warp is nonfunctional, but I assume the warp back is to the right of the right statue you spawned at. I know this is true in High Tech, and I assume other cities too.
* Imposter Oak lives in New Tech with what I assume is his wife.
* New Tech's pokemart is bugged, with a somewhat scrambled tileset.
* Only Silent Hill and the route connecting it to Old Town have collision, NPC interaction scripts, battles and encounters. The rest has no collision data or NPC scripts, so you can walk through anything that isn't hardcoded (like cut trees and water) and the NPCs simply turn to face you without saying anything if you interact with them.
* Some NPCs use the player's sprite.
* The Starters, Hoothoot etc. do not evolve in the demo (although Caterpie/metapod still do), but that will be fixed in the hack.
* Tall grass without encounter data cannot be walked through without the debug's run bypass mechanic.
* Big rocks that I found to the left of High Tech push you left if you go over them without the run. I assume they are intended to be for Strength.
